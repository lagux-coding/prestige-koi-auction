##  :beginner: About
**Prestige Koi Auction** is a modern and user-friendly platform designed to facilitate the buying and selling of koi fish through live auctions. Built with scalability and transparency in mind, this platform enables **Koi Breeders**, **Managers**, **Staff**, and **Members** to interact seamlessly while maintaining fair and organized auctions.  

The system emphasizes:  
- **Efficient Management**: Streamlined processes for request approvals, inspections, and slot assignments.  
- **Financial Transparency**: Clear records of deposits, refunds, payments, and fees.  
- **Seamless User Experience**: Intuitive interfaces for both auction participants and administrators.  

## 🚀 **Features Overview**

### 📋 **Auction Management**  
- **Auction Sessions**:  
  - Managers create auction sessions with multiple lots.  
  - Each lot represents one koi fish for bidding.

  - Managers approve requests or assign inspections to Staff.  

### 💳 **Financial Transactions**

 ### :cactus: Branches

 I use an agile continuous integration methodology, so the version is frequently updated and development is really fast.

1. **`stage`** is the development branch.

2. **`master`** is the production branch.

3. No other permanent branches should be created in the main repository, you can create feature branches but they should get merged with the master.

**Steps to work with feature branch**

1. To start working on a new feature, create a new branch prefixed with `feat` and followed by feature name. (ie. `feat-FEATURE-NAME`)
2. Once you are done with your changes, you can raise PR.

**Steps to create a pull request**

1. Make a PR to `stage` branch.
2. Comply with the best practices and guidelines e.g. where the PR concerns visual elements it should have an image showing the effect.
3. It must pass all continuous integration checks and get positive reviews.

After this, changes will be merged.
